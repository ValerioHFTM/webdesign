        <h2>Shelter</h2>
        <p>
          While travalling there are three importent points: Shelter, Water and maybe also food.
          <br>
          Here we try to show you some possibilities to cover the first part.
          <br>
          Shelter provides protection from the elements, including extreme temperatures, wind, rain, and snow. 
          It helps regulate body temperature and prevents hypothermia or heat-related illnesses. Shelter can also protect you from wildlife and insects. 
          In survival situations, a well-constructed shelter can make a significant difference in your comfort and safety.
          <br>
          <strong>Natural Shelters:</strong>
<br>
Caves: Natural caves can provide excellent shelter from the elements. They offer protection from rain, wind, and temperature extremes. However, caves may not be readily available in all environments, and they can also pose safety risks due to wildlife or unstable conditions.
<br>
Rock Overhangs: Rock formations with overhangs or crevices can offer partial shelter. They are better than nothing but may not provide complete protection, especially during heavy rain or cold weather.
<br>
<strong>Tarp Shelters:</strong>
<br>
Tarp Lean-To: Using a tarp or rainfly to create a lean-to shelter is a popular and effective choice. 
It's relatively easy to set up and provides good protection from rain and wind. However, it may not offer insulation from cold temperatures.
<br>
A-Frame Tarp Shelter: This is another tarp-based shelter that resembles an A-frame tent. It offers good protection from rain and wind but can be less stable in strong winds.
<br>
<strong>Debris Shelters:</strong>
<br>
Debris Hut: Constructing a debris hut involves creating a framework from branches and covering it with leaves, moss, or other natural materials. It provides insulation and protection from the elements. However, building one can be time-consuming and physically demanding.
<br>
Snow Cave/Igloo: In snowy environments, you can build a snow cave or igloo for shelter. These snow shelters provide excellent insulation. However, they require specialized knowledge and tools to construct safely.
<br>
<strong>Tent Shelters:</strong>
<br>
Backpacking Tent: A lightweight backpacking tent is a convenient and reliable shelter option. It offers protection from rain, wind, and insects. However, it requires carrying the tent with you, which may not be suitable for all survival situations.
<br>
Emergency Survival Tent: These compact, lightweight tents are designed for emergency situations. They're easy to set up and provide decent protection. However, they may not be as durable as regular tents.
<br>
<strong>Cordage and Poncho Shelters:</strong>
<br>
Paracord Shelter: Using paracord and a tarp or poncho, you can create various shelter configurations like a tube tent or a diamond shelter. These are lightweight and versatile options, but they may not provide the same level of protection as sturdier structures.
