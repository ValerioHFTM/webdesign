        <h4>The Review in details</h4>
        <h5>Price</h5>
        <p>
        The cost of Dr. Bronner's 18-in-1 soap seems reasonable to me. 
        Initially, it might appear a tad expensive, but it goes a long way due to its high concentration. 
        One bottle lasts an impressively long time, making it a wallet-friendly choice for a variety of cleaning needs.

        <h5>Comfort</h5>
        <p>
          While Dr. Bronner's soap works well for most cleaning tasks, it falls short in terms of comfort when used on hair. 
          The regular use can lead to hair developing a tangled, "rasta-like" texture after a few days. 
          Therefore, I prefer to use it as a body wash or for household cleaning, where it excels in durability and effectiveness.
        </p>
        <h5>Style</h5>
        <p>
          One aspect of Dr. Bronner's that I particularly appreciate is the range of flavors available. 
          There's something for every scent preference, from refreshing peppermint to soothing lavender and even almond. 
          The packaging, with its distinctive labels filled with quotes and messages, adds a unique and interesting touch. 
          However, I should note that this eclectic design may not suit everyone's tastes, which is why I've given it a slightly lower rating in this category.
        </p>

        <h5>Durability</h5>
        <p>
          Dr. Bronner's soap has proven to be a versatile and long-lasting cleaning product in my experience. 
          Its high concentration ensures it can handle frequent use for an extended period. 
          Whether I'm using it as a body wash or for household cleaning, I can rely on its consistency and effectiveness over time.
