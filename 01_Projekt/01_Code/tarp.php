        <h5>Style: Nature's Chameleon</h5>
        <p>
        The multicam design of this tarp blends well into natural outdoor settings, providing a degree of camouflage. 
        From a distance, it looks like a great fit for the environment. However, upon closer inspection, the material can appear somewhat plastic-like, 
        diminishing its style rating. It's functional but not the most aesthetically pleasing.
        </p>
        <h5>Durability: Baselayer proofed</h5>
        <p>
        The durability of the Helikon Supertarp is truly commendable. 
        It has withstood challenging conditions, including being used as a baselayer for the MSR Access 3 on rocky terrain. 
        Despite this rough treatment, it has remained waterproof with no noticeable issues, demonstrating its impressive longevity and resilience.
        Overall, the Helikon Supertarp offers excellent value for the price, is easy to set up, and boasts impressive durability. 
        Its style is functional for outdoor use, even though it may have a slightly plastic-like appearance up close. 
        If you prioritize durability and reliability in your outdoor gear, this tarp is a solid choice.
