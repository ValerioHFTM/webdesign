        <h5>Supplier Description</h5>
        <p class="manufacturerDescription">
          The TT Raid Pack MK III has a main compartment with a volume of 48
          liters and two fixed side pockets with a volume of 2 liters each.
          MOLLE on the front, the lid, the side pockets and on the hip belt
          allows individual extension. The V2 Plus Carrying System of the
          backpack is designed for a weight of up to approx. 40 kilograms and
          offers great variability when adjusting the back length. Due to the
          removable hip belt, the backpack can also be carried with fully
          equipped chest rigs and vests. The hip belt can be used separately as
          a Warrior Belt.

        <h4>The Review in details</h4>
        <h5>Price</h5>
        <p>
          Compared to other products with the same size the Raid Pack mk III is
          more expensive. <br />
          Usually a Backpack with 50-55l is ranged between 180.- CHF to 300.-
          CHF
          <br />
          With Tasmanian Tiger being a rather expensive brand it is no surprise
          that the Raid Pack MK III is available for around 350.- CHF to 450.-
          CHF

          The One for around 450.- CHF is a special Infrared repellend color /
          material. It is only used for the military.
        </p>
        <h5>Comfort</h5>
        <p>
          I carried the Backpack for over 200km and I never had any complaints
          regarding comfort. <br />
          The carrier system from Tasmainan Tiger is one of the best in my
          opinion.
          <br />
          Even though I would not recommend the backpack to people smaller than
          1.65m. Tasmanian Tiger is clearly designed for military use and they
          assume the average soldier is about 1.80m.<br />
          Never the less, you can see in my <a href="#">description</a> I am not
          taller than 1.70m and on smallest setting it works for me.
        </p>
        <h5>Style</h5>
        <p>
          For a lot of People this will be the most important and to be honest
          it was a big selling point to me aswell. <br />
          If you dig the Military looks, of course sooner or later you will
          stuble upon products from Tasmainan Tiger. They have a huge range of
          any Military related products which have also a real use in the
          civilan world (most of the time anyway).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Military looks are not over the top. There is no camouflage
          pattern. It only comes in solid colors (green, black, beige and the
          IRR green).
