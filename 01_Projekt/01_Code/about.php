              Well, This is us.
              <br />
              "The guy on the right, that's Mateusz. Mateusz is always working and has a pretty cool motorcycle. Needless to say, the girls are all running after him. 
              <br>
              Or so I've heard. <br />
              The fancy lad on the left side is Valerio. He is always sleepy, but his mom says she's proud of him.
              He is 1.70m tall and loves walking. The weather is not important. Rain? Snow? Or heat? He always adapts, and he tries to be outside as much as possible."
