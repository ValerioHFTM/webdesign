        <h5>Supplier Description</h5>
        <p class="manufacturerDescription">
        The Nitro Team Splitboard allows everyone to enjoy regular chairlift days at the ski resort on a comfortable and versatile snowboard, 
        but with the added advantage of being able to venture beyond the marked slopes to reach remote peaks. 
        This means that Team Splitboarders can leave the resort on a busy weekend and embark on a backcountry tour in search of fresh descents and new perspectives. 
        The Team Split's Dual Degressive Sidecut, Directional Twin Shape, and progressive widths ensure that this board feels like a normal resort cruiser. 
        The Tr√ºe Camber and Standard Core Profile provide you with the necessary grip and support for uphill and downhill touring.
<br>
<br>
Equipped with Nitro's robust Tail and Tip Locks, forged T7075 aluminum hooks, and the Nitro x Kohla Attachment System, 
you can switch to Splitboarding Hike Mode whenever you feel like it. 
Just remember to have your backcountry gear and the specially tailored Nitro x Kohla Peak Skins in your backpack.
<br>
<br>
In the past, you had to choose between buying a new Splitboard or a regular snowboard. 
Now, you no longer need to invest in both or choose between a Splitboard or a resort snowboard setup. 
You can finally get a versatile all-mountain board that does it all - the new Nitro Team Split!

        <h4>The Review in details</h4>
    <h5>Size</h5>
    <p>
      The Nitro Cinema Felt great on my legs. It is light which makes a feeling that I have nothing attached to my legs.
      The size 159 fits my weight well stance is very comfortable as it's natural, I have no problem with turns in it,
      although I'm used to smaller sizes.
    </p>
    <h5>Flex</h5>
    <p>
      Very good flex, it's in my opinion the better ones I tried. <b>It's not too soft yet it's not crazy stiff </b>.
      Really a
      pleasant pop and a great response to tearing up the slope.
    </p>
    <h5>On snow feel</h5>
    <p>
      So easy to ride and so forgiving for those that skid turns or just want a ride that is less likely than camber to
      catch an edge. Like all hybrid rocker boards, it has that semi-stable feel underfoot that wants to auto-spin one
      footing or flat basing in harder snow but it becomes pretty stable in softer snow.
    </p>
    <h5>Turning experience</h5>
    <p>
      Again it's really good, it can edge really nice, but also depends on how "how low can you go" and "if you're brave
      enough". Speed and your own limits are key here. I'm not having years of expereience but
      the turning experience was much better than competition.
